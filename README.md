# About

The German parliament currently aims to make substantial new debt. The background is geopolitical instabilities, lackluster economics, and broken infrastructure. I took this opportunity to look closer at the amount of debt that Germany *already has*. I found quite some impressive numbers.

But plain numbers cannot convey a sense of proportion here. We might understand what €1000 can afford us, or that €1 million are enough to stop working in an instant. But what's the difference between €1 million and €1 billion?

Here's 1 000 000 versus 1 000 000 000. Three additional zeros seem to be all the difference. But how does that look like?

To answer this, I created a simple webpage that shows key (debt) stats from Germany. Each pixel is €1000.

If you are curious: the web page goes up to €3,47 *trillion*. Scroll down here to find more


## Acknowledement
This is based on prior works used to visualize the distribution of wealth among American billionaires, which can be found here: [https://dbkrupp.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/](https://dbkrupp.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/).

I cleaned it down and added vertical scrolling (yes, you may need to scroll for a looooong time to see the bottom).

## A note on the accuracy of the numbers
I strived to find reliable, official sources for Germany's debts. However, I am not a financial expert, so my numbers might be off. But, and this is a large but: it won't matter. A few more pixels (i.e., €1000) are not noticable, especially not in the billion+ ranges. After all, I am not trying to present the most accurate numbers, but to convey a sense of what the Germans are up to.
